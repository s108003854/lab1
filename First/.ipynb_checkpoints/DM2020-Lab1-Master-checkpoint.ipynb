    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook I will explore a text-based, document-based [dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/text_analytics/working_with_text_data.html) using scientific computing tools such as Pandas and Numpy. In addition, several fundamental Data Mining concepts will be explored and explained in details, ranging from calculating distance measures to computing term frequency vectors. Coding examples, visualizations and demonstrations will be provided where necessary. Furthermore, additional exercises are provided after special topics. These exercises are geared towards testing the proficiency of students and motivate students to explore beyond the techniques covered in the notebook. "

A short description of the dataset, provided by the authors, is provided below:\n",

    "- *The 20 Newsgroups data set is a collection of approximately 20,000 newsgroup documents, partitioned (nearly) evenly across 20 different newsgroups. To the best of our knowledge, it was originally collected by Ken Lang, probably for his paper “Newsweeder: Learning to filter netnews,” though he does not explicitly mention this collection. The 20 newsgroups collection has become a popular data set for experiments in text applications of machine learning techniques, such as text classification and text clustering.*\n",

The area in this domain \twhich is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming \tloop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments. \tFor the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.  \tMy problem is this : \tThe trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller \tcells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell \tis wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole , \telse it is trivially rejected.   \tDoes any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo.  \tsomewhere for doing this.  \tAny help would be appreciated.  \tThanks,  \tAni. --  To get irritated is human, to stay cool, divine. \n",

San Diego Lines: 63  (Well, I'll email also, but this may apply to other people, so I'll post also.)  >I've been working at this company for eight years in various >engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that >on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this >company.  >I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask >me some kind of question...  Your boss should be the person bring these problems to.  If he/she does not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher. Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)  You may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband, etc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is supportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.  >So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single >person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one >could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my >number was posted.  This happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem to be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are going through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while working than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...) I've had this happen to me a lot, often because they didn't realize my car was broken, etc.  Then they will come back and wonder why I didn't want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at being ignored and make me laugh).  Once, we went off without our boss, who was paying for the lunch :-)  >For this >reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.  Well, if you can't turn to the computer for support, what would we do?  (signs of the computer age :-)  In closing, please don't let the hateful actions of a single person harm you.  They are doing it because they are still the playground bully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause.  And you should not accept the opinions of an imbecile that you are worthless - much wiser people hold you in great esteem. --  Darin Johnson djohnson@ucsd.edu   - Luxury!

    "First, let us consider that our dataset has some *missing values* and we want to remove those values. In its current state our dataset has no missing values, but for practice sake we will add some records with missing values and then write some code to deal with these objects that contain missing values. You will see for yourself how easy it is to deal with missing values once you have your data transformed into a Pandas dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we jump into coding, let us do a quick review of what we have learned in the Data Mining course. Specifically, let's review the methods used to deal with missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common reasons for having missing values in datasets has to do with how the data was initially collected. A good example of this is when a patient comes into the ER room, the data is collected as quickly as possible and depending on the conditions of the patients, the personal data being collected is either incomplete or partially complete. In the former and latter cases, we are presented with a case of \"missing values\". Knowing that patients data is particularly critical and can be used by the health authorities to conduct some interesting analysis, we as the data miners are left with the tough task of deciding what to do with these missing and incomplete records. We need to deal with these records because they are definitely going to affect our analysis or learning algorithms. So what do we do? There are several ways to handle missing values, and some of the more effective ways are presented below (Note: You can reference the slides - Session 1 Handout for the additional information).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eliminate Data Objects** - Here we completely discard records once they contain some missing values. This is the easiest approach and the one we will be using in this notebook. The immediate drawback of going with this approach is that you lose some information, and in some cases too much of it. Now imagine that half of the records have at least one or more missing values. Here you are presented with the tough decision of quantity vs quality. In any event, this decision must be made carefully, hence the reason for emphasizing it here in this notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Estimate Missing Values** - Here we try to estimate the missing values based on some criteria. Although this approach may be proven to be effective, it is not always the case, especially when we are dealing with sensitive data, like **Gender** or **Names**. For fields like **Address**, there could be ways to obtain these missing addresses using some data aggregation technique or obtain the information directly from other databases or public data sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ignore the missing value during analysis** - Here we basically ignore the missing values and proceed with our analysis. Although this is the most naive way to handle missing values it may proof effective, especially when the missing values includes information that is not important to the analysis being conducted. But think about it for a while. Would you ignore missing values, especially when in this day and age it is difficult to obtain high quality datasets? Again, there are some tradeoffs, which we will talk about later in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Replace with all possible values** - As an efficient and responsible data miner, we sometimes just need to put in the hard hours of work and find ways to makes up for these missing values. This last option is a very wise option for cases where data is scarce (which is almost always) or when dealing with sensitive data. Imagine that our dataset has an **Age** field, which contains many missing values. Since **Age** is a continuous variable, it means that we can build a separate model for calculating the age for the incomplete records based on some rule-based appraoch or probabilistic approach.  "

But let us start to get our hands dirty and build a nice little function to check each of the records, column by column, and return a nice little message telling us the amount of missing records found. This excerice will also encourage us to explore other capabilities of pandas dataframes. In most cases, the build-in functions are good enough, but as you saw above when the entire table was printed, it is impossible to tell if there are missing records just by looking at preview of records manually, especially in cases where the dataset is huge.

We then take the transformed table and apply a function to each row that essentially counts to see if there are missing values in each record and print out how much missing values we found. In other words the `check_missing_values` function looks through each field (attribute or column) in the dataset and counts how many missing values were found. \n",

    "### 4.2 Dealing with Duplicate Data\n",
    "Dealing with duplicate data is just as painful as dealing with missing data. The worst case is that you have duplicate data that has missing values. But let us not get carried away. Let us stick with the basics. As we have learned in our Data Mining course, duplicate data can occur because of many reasons. The majority of the times it has to do with how we store data or how we collect and merge data. For instance, we may have collected and stored a tweet, and a retweet of that same tweet as two different records; this results in a case of data duplication; the only difference being that one is the original tweet and the other the retweeted one. Here you will learn that dealing with duplicate data is not as challenging as missing values. But this also all depends on what you consider as duplicate data, i.e., this all depends on your criteria for what is considered as a duplicate record and also what type of data you are dealing with. For textual data, it may not be so trivial as it is for numerical values or images. Anyhow, let us look at some code on how to deal with duplicate records in our `X` dataframe."

So yes, all the `duplicated()` operation does is to check per records instead of per column. That is why the operation only returns one value instead of three values for each column. It appears that we don't have any duplicates since none of our records resulted in `True`. If we want to check for duplicates as we did above for some particular column, instead of all columns, we do something as shown below. As you may have noticed, in the case where we select some columns instead of checking by all columns, we are kind of lowering the criteria of what is considered as a duplicate record.

In fact, we have already done some sampling by just reducing the records we are using here in this notebook; remember that we are only using four categories from the all the 20 categories available. Let us get an idea on how to sample using pandas operations."

That is not the main focus in this notebook, but if you would like to know more about sampling and how the `sample` feature works, just reference the Pandas documentation and you will find interesting ways to conduct more advanced sampling."

    "### 5.2 Feature Creation\n",
    "The other operation from the list above that we are going to practise on is the so-called feature creation. As the name suggests, in feature creation we are looking at creating new interesting and useful features from the original dataset; a feature which captures the most important information from the raw information we already have access to. In our `X` table, we would like to create some features from the `text` field, but we are still not sure what kind of features we want to create. We can think of an interesting problem we want to solve, or something we want to analyze from the data, or some questions we want to answer. This is one process to come up with features -- this process is usually called `feature engineering` in the data science community. \n",
    "\n",
    "We know what feature creation is so let us get real involved with our dataset and make it more interesting by adding some special features or attributes if you will. First, we are going to obtain the **unigrams** for each text. (Unigram is just a fancy word we use in Text Mining which stands for 'tokens' or 'individual words'.) Yes, we want to extract all the words found in each text and append it as a new feature to the pandas dataframe. The reason for extracting unigrams is not so clear yet, but we can start to think of obtaining some statistics about the articles we have: something like **word distribution** or **word frequency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going into any further coding, we will also introduce a useful text mining library called [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/). The NLTK library is a natural language processing tool used for text mining tasks, so might as well we start to familiarize ourselves with it from now (It may come in handy for the final project!). In partcular, we are going to use the NLTK library to conduct tokenization because we are interested in splitting a sentence into its individual components, which we refer to as words, emojis, emails, etc. So let us go for it! We can call the `nltk` library as follows:\n",

    "### 5.6 Discretization and Binarization\n",
    "In this section we are going to discuss a very important pre-preprocessing technique used to transform the data, specifically categorical values, into a format that satisfies certain criteria required by particular algorithms. Given our current original dataset, we would like to transform one of the attributes, `category_name`, into four binary attributes. In other words, we are taking the category name and replacing it with a `n` asymmetric binary attributes. The logic behind this transformation is discussed in detail in the recommended Data Mining text book (please refer to it on page 58). People from the machine learning community also refer to this transformation as one-hot encoding, but as you may become aware later in the course, these concepts are all the same, we just have different prefrence on how we refer to the concepts. Let us take a look at what we want to achieve in code. "
